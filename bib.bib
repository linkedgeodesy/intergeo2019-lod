	abstract = {As the amount of Linked Open Data on the web increases, so does the amount of data with an inherent spatial context. Without spatial reasoning, however, the value of this spatial context is limited. Over the past decade there have been several vocabularies and query languages that attempt to exploit this knowledge and enable spatial reasoning. These attempts provide varying levels of support for fundamental geospatial concepts. In this paper, we look at the overall state of geospatial data in the Semantic Web, with a focus on the upcoming OGC standard GeoSPARQL. GeoSPARQL attempts to unify data access for the geospatial Semantic Web. We ﬁrst describe the motivation for GeoSPARQL, then the current state of the art in industry and research, followed by an example use case, and the implementation of GeoSPARQL in the Parliament triple store.},

The amount of data contributed by LinkedGeoData to the Data Web reaches more than 3 billion RDF triples. It contains descriptions of entities with a spatial location such as roads, buildings, shops, pubs, mailboxes. Most of these entities were previously not available on the Data Web. For the ones available, we applied automatic interlinking techniques to DBpedia and thus other LOD datasets with a spatial dimension. In order to explore this wealth of information we implemented a tool, which combines the faceted-browsing approach with a spatial dimension and employs sophisticated data aggregation techniques to facilitate the smooth browsing of this enormous data source.},

@article{mark_modeling_1994,
	title = {Modeling {Spatial} {Relations} {Between} {Lines} and {Regions}: {Combining} {Formal} {Mathematical} {Models} and {Human} {Subjects} {Testing}},
	abstract = {This paper describes the results of a series of human-subjects experiments to test how people think about spatial relations between lines and regions. The experiments are centered on a formal model of topological spatial relations, called the 9-intersection. For unbranched lines and simplyconnected regions, this model identifies 19 different spatial relations. Subjects were presented with two or three geometrically-distinct drawings of each spatial relation (40 drawings in all), with the line and the region said to be a road and a park, respectively. In the first experiment, the task was to group the drawings so that the same phrase or sentence could be used to describe every situation in each group. A few subjects differentiated all 19 relations, but most identified 9 to 13 groups. Although there was a great deal of variation across subjects in the groups that were identified, the results confirm that the relations grouped by the 9-intersection model are the ones most often grouped by the subjects. No consistent language-related differences were identified among 12 English-speaking subjects, 12 Chinesespeaking subjects, and 4 other subjects tested in their own native languages. A second experiment presented the subjects with a short sentence describing a spatial relation between a road and a park, and the same 40 diagrams. Each subject was asked to rate the strength of their agreement or disagreement that the sentence described each relation. For each of the two different predicates tested—“the road crosses the park” and “the road goes into the park”—there was a great deal of consensus across the subjects. The results of these experiments suggest that the 9-intersection model forms a sound basis for characterizing line-region relations in the case of roads and parks, and that many spatial relations can be well-represented by particular subsets of the primitives differentiated by the 9-intersection.},
